# 🛡️ Credit Card Fraud Detection (Supervised Learning)

## 📖 Project Overview
Credit card fraud is a major issue in financial transactions.  
In this project, I built a **supervised machine learning model** to detect fraudulent transactions.  
The dataset is highly **imbalanced** (only ~0.17% fraud), making it a real-world ML challenge.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect fraudulent transactions using supervised learning  
- Handle imbalanced data using **SMOTE**  
- Evaluate using **precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC**
